      1. Routing using express
      2. Connection with MongoDB Atlas
      3. Authentication using JWT
      4. REST Api for certiain routes
      5. Tested API's using Postman
      6. Very basic front-end for login and signup routes
      7. Storing user details to database

#### Purpose

    - Create a signup form with at least 6 fields, of which one should be a date field.
    - Create a login form.
    - When a user logs in, show them a page with a list creator. There will be a text box into which the user can enter something and on press of enter, the item will be added to the database and populate the updated database in the list.
    - Create an admin grid where the list of all users can be seen in a grid.
    - Write APIs to handle data to be processed with all the forms and make it a functional application.
